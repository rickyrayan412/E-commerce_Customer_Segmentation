# E-commerce_Customer_Segmentation
## Abstract :
- A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.
# Problem Statement :
- Given the e-commerce data, use a k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interests.
# Dataset Information:
- The data was collected from a well-known e-commerce website over a period of time based on the customer’s search profile.
# Scope :
- Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights about the purchase pattern
- Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
- Segmenting customers based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’) with the help of silhouette score.
# What is K-Means Clustering Algorithm?
- K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science.
